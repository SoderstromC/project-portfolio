# portfolio

The assignment was to build our portfolio using HTML and CSS and style with flexbox or grid. The portfolio should be responsive and worklook and function the same in several browsers. In addition to this the portfolio needs to be accessible to people using screen readers and keyboard navigation, and lastly it should validate in a validation tool.

LEARNINGS:
- This week I forgot to start with a sketch and plan which resultet in me not having enough time to finalise the project in a good way, and a lot of accessibility errors are still left unresolved.

- Another interesting learning is that my design style is non-inclusive. I dont like to use dark colors and my color scheme is a mix of bright and dim colors This does not offer up a lot of contrast which is a problem from an accessibility point of view.

- Using borders to identify parents and children is a great help when styling using flexbox

- Every time I've googled something this week I've found quick and easy solutions or tools to problems I thought would be difficult to solve. 

- Start small and iterate, it makes things a lot more easy to adjust especially in this kind of project where you need to validate and pay attention to semantix.

TAKE AWAYS:
- Stick to my process -> Make a sketch, make a priority order of the things I need to solve for, make a plan based on the sketch and prio list, stick to the plan. This week I really felt the heat of choosing to freestyle and have learned my lesson.

- Explore how I can evolve my style language to include more contrast and accessibility elements whilst still staying true to me. Leaving a lot of commented content in style sheet to know where to explore further, instead of cleaning it up.

- I should use google a lot more than I do currently.
